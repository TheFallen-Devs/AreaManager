Minecraft plugin which runs on paper.

## Features
Temporarily, I wrote these on README. I`ll move this to wiki as soon as possible :P

### Commands
> /area create (name)

Creates an area based on WorldEdit selection. If you haven't selected area using WorldEdit, the command will output an error message.

> /area setting (name)

Open setting GUI to manage settings of the area.

## Dependency
This plugin depends on WorldEdit API, so this plugin requires Worldedit to be used.
